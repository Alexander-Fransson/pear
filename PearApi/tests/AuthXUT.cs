* Welcome new victims to the api unit tests, as you soon will notice, it is quite dificult to decouple       *
* the methods of the api from the aplication due to the hevy use of dependencies. You ither have to find out *
* and use the method that the aplication uses, create a class that mocks the behavure of the dependency you  *
* need using a library such as Moq,                                                                          *
*                                                                                                            *
* tutorial -> https://docs.educationsmediagroup.com/unit-testing-csharp/moq/quick-glance-at-moq),            *
*                                                                                                            *
* or create fake ones like I have done with the fake database and its clones in the TestDB folder.           *
*                                                                                                            *
* On the topic, if I haven't mentioned it somewhare else the other Controller tests workes in the maner that *
* thay create a database template and then clone it for every test class that is run and re-seeds the them   *
* on every test. The proes of this is that every test is isolated and wont affect the others but the conns   *
* are that it is verry slow, like half a minutefor all the tests to complete. If you want it faster maybe    *
* you could run all the tests in one class and skip the database cloning and maybe also ski√• the ree seeding *
* on every test. Maybe you could create one test for every constructor and instead have all the individual   *
* methods as separate assertions?                                                                            *
*                                                                                                            *
* This would be quite un object oriented of you but it none the less could improve preformance. Do not       *
* under any circomstances swich to entity framework in memory database as database Context during the tests. *
* While it improves preformance it also causes them to fail 25% of the time entigherly randomly. Another     *
* faster database solution is the in memoryy SQLite but as it is a diferent database language than the real  *
* app wich uses postgres it can behave diferently in diferent circomstances.                                 *
*                                                                                                            *
* Below I have begun to create the tests for the Authcontroller but it has prooven highly dificult           *
* as it has several dependencies wich preform complex tasks. I am nonetheless confident that you will        *
* succeed. Just remember that it is usualy harder to read code than to wright it is none the less important  *
* that you understand the code you test. I tried to be lazy and do the bare minimum but I just ended up      *
* confused and with failing tests. Ideally try to make the people that wright the code to wright tests for   *
* it as well becouse ultimately they are the ones that understand it best and as the bottles of OOP book     *
* states tests are suposed to give information about the code. Information that most likely only the authot  *
* posess.                                                                                                    *
